# Weather-App.github.io
Demonstrating the ability to work with a weather API, while giving functionality for someone to check the weather. 

Project Title = Weather Service

1. What is this project?
    This project is designed to store searches of cities in a local setting while, also interacting with a server side API known as "Open Weather API"

2. Why am I making this project?
    This interface will create a helpful tool for people looking to search up there local weather without having to constanty interact with ads, and other annoyances on the common weather websites. It will be light weight and run fast.


This project has been completed using a myriad of tools along the way. Including the mastery of filling in links wether they be sources for images or ajax calls. Along the way I tried to add more and more features while fixing old bugs. Can confidnelty say this is the most organized code I have yet to have, and any bugs come at the expense of my lack of knowledge. Although there have been many apps such as this one, I beleive that this app showcases my abilities wether it be in design, repsonsivness, and mainly showcases my drastic improvemnt in writing and executing functions using Jquery.
